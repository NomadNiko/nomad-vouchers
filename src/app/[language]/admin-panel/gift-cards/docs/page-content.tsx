      <SectionTitle>Overview</SectionTitle>
      <P>
        This is a multi-tenant platform that manages the full lifecycle of gift
        vouchers — from creating templates and selling cards through your
        website, to redeeming them in-house and tracking every transaction. A
        single deployment serves multiple clients (tenants), each with their own
        isolated templates, gift cards, widgets, settings, and users.
      </P>
      <Sub>Multi-Tenant Architecture</Sub>
      <P>
        Each client operates as a separate tenant. Data is fully isolated — a
        tenant admin can only see and manage their own client&apos;s gift cards,
        templates, widgets, settings, and users. Super admins can see and manage
        all tenants.
      </P>
      <P>
        The Tenant Switcher in the top-right of the navigation bar shows the
        current tenant name. If you have access to multiple tenants, click it to
        switch between them. The page reloads with the new tenant&apos;s data.

        Every gift voucher has a QR code. When scanned, it automatically routes

        If an email address is entered instead of a code, the system returns all

      <Sub>Authentication &amp; Authorisation</Sub>
      <P>
        JWT-based authentication via Passport. Tokens are issued at login and
        refreshed via a refresh token endpoint. The login and /auth/me responses
        include a tenants[] array listing the user&apos;s tenant access.
      </P>
      <P>
        Multi-tenant access control uses three layers: TenantMiddleware extracts
        the x-tenant-id header, TenantGuard validates the user has access to
        that tenant via UserTenantAccess, and RolesGuard checks the
        tenant-scoped role. Super admins bypass all checks.

      <Sub>Gift Voucher Lifecycle</Sub>
      <P>The complete flow from purchase to redemption:</P>
      <Step n={1}>
        Purchase triggered via: widget (Stripe checkout or sandbox), Squarespace
        order polling, or staff Generate page.
      </Step>
      <Step n={2}>
        GiftCardsService.purchase() generates a unique code using the
        template&apos;s prefix (e.g. THW-XXXX-XXXX), creates the database record
        with status &quot;active&quot;.
      </Step>
      <Step n={3}>
        MailService sends: purchase confirmation to purchaser (with PDF
        attachment), recipient email if different, and purchase notification to
        the notification email list.
      </Step>
      <Step n={4}>
        PDF is generated via Puppeteer — renders the template image with code
        overlay and QR code to a headless Chrome instance, exports as PDF.
      </Step>
      <Step n={5}>
        On redemption, the service checks: card exists, not fully
        redeemed/cancelled, not expired, amount does not exceed balance. Creates
        a Redemption entry with unique ID, updates balance and status.
      </Step>
      <Step n={6}>
        Un-redeem marks the redemption as reversed, restores the balance, and
        recalculates the status.
      </Step>

      <Sub>Squarespace Integration</Sub>
      <P>
        The SquarespaceService polls the Squarespace Commerce Orders API on a
        configurable interval. It uses the modifiedAfter/modifiedBefore
        parameters to fetch only new orders since the last poll.
      </P>
      <P>
        For each order line item, it matches the productName against configured
        pay links (exact match). Deduplication uses a composite key of
        orderId:lineItemId stored in the squarespaceOrderId field.
      </P>
      <P>
        The service listens for the &quot;settings.updated&quot; event (emitted
        when settings are saved) and automatically restarts polling with the new
        configuration. The updateLastPollAt() method deliberately does not emit
        this event to avoid a restart loop.
      </P>

      <Sub>Stripe Integration (Per-Tenant)</Sub>
      <P>
        Each tenant has their own Stripe secret key and webhook secret stored in
        their Settings. Widgets create a Stripe Checkout Session via the
        /gift-cards/create-checkout-session endpoint. The tenantId is stored in
        the session metadata alongside gift card details.
      </P>
      <P>
        The /gift-cards/stripe-webhook endpoint receives
        checkout.session.completed events. It parses the raw JSON to extract
        metadata.tenantId before signature verification, then uses that
        tenant&apos;s webhook secret to verify the signature and creates the
        gift voucher. All client Stripe accounts point their webhooks to the
        same server URL.
      </P>

      <Sub>Email System</Sub>
      <P>
        The MailService uses Handlebars templates in src/mail/mail-templates/:
      </P>
      <Paper variant="outlined" sx={{ p: 2, mb: 2 }}>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="div">

      <P>
        PDFs are generated using Puppeteer with headless Chrome. The
        generate-gift-card-pdf.ts utility renders an HTML page with the template
        image, code overlay, and QR code, then exports it as a PDF or PNG image.
